Q: can you summarize the things what is what's in the document
A: The document contains information about an individual named Prathyush Kumar Reddy Lebaku. It includes details about his education, skills, and a specific project he worked on. Here are the key points:

1. **Education**:
   - **University of Houston**: Prathyush is pursuing a Master of Science in Engineering Data Science with a CGPA of 3.89/4.0 from August 2023 to May 2025. His coursework includes Deep Learning, Data Structures and Algorithms, Advanced Machine Learning, Probability and Statistics, Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, Big Data Processing, Artificial Intelligence, Data Analysis, and Object-oriented programming.
   - **Vellore Institute of Technology**: No specific details are provided about his education here.

2. **Contact Information**:
   - Phone: +1 713-873-1975
   - Location: Houston, TX
   - Email: plebaku@cougarnet.uh.edu
   - LinkedIn, GitHub, and Portfolio links are mentioned but not specified.

3. **Summary**:
   - Prathyush has experience as a Data Analyst and AI Engineer with a strong understanding of deep learning models and large language models (LLMs). He has a keen interest in data extraction, preprocessing, and deploying intelligent solutions for real-world applications.

4. **Project**:
   - **Context-Aware Question Answering System Using LLMs**: From May 2024 to July 2024, Prathyush fine-tuned BERT Base and BiDAF models on the SQuAD v2.0 dataset to build a question-answering system.
